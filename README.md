SUBJECT: JumpCloud QA Interview Exercise

-Please find, in this repository, the file "AAK - JumpCloud Exercise.xlsx".

-In order to keep things simple, I grouped tests into "Positive" and "Negative". They could also be grouped based on what part of the application they pertained to (e.g. "Initialization", "Hashing", "Stats", "Shutdown", etc.).

-I noted any defects or issues I found in the "Notes" column of the spreadsheet.

-After intially relying on Terminal, I decided to run commands to the application via Postman and using Firefox as well. Postman proved useful in testing >1 concurrent requests.

-In order to make the repository [much] less likely to be scraped, I appended an 8 character random string to the repository name.
