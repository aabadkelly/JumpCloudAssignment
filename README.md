SUBJECT: JumpCloud QA Interview Exercise

-Please find, in this repository, the file "AAK - JumpCloud Exercise.xlsx".

-In order to keep things simple, I grouped tests in to "Postive" and "Negative" test cases. They could also be grouped based on what part of the application they pertained to (e.g. "Initialization", "Hashing", "Stats", "Shutdown", etc.).

-After intially relying on Terminal, I decided to run commands to the application via Postman and using Firefox as well. Postman proved useful in testing >1 concurrent requests.
